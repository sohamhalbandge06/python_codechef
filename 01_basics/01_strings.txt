Strings
---

1. Concatenation

'Hello' + 'World' -> 'HelloWorld'

2. Repetition

'hello' * 3 -> 'hellohellohello'

3. Length

string = 'hello'
len(string) # 5

4. Lower and Upper case

string = 'Codechef'
print(string.upper()) # 'CODECHEF'
print(string.lower()) # 'codechef'

5. Changing Characters

myString = 'Chaf'
myString_new = myString.replace('a', 'e')
print(myString_new) # Chef

Indexing
----

		  0   1   2   3   4   5  --> forward indexing
string = 'P   y   t   h   o   n'
		 -6	 -5  -4  -3  -2  -1  --> negative indexing


Positive Indexing -> Python index starts from 0.
Negative Indexing -> Starts from end of the string. The last character is at index '-1'

to access index elements

string[0] -> 'P'
string[-1] -> 'n'

Slicing
---

Slicing is way to extract part from a string.

Syntax1: string[start:end]

When you specify a start index in a string slice, Python includes the character at that index as the starting point of your new substring.

The end index is exclusive. This means the character at the end index is not included in the resulting substring. The slice stops just before it.

To get the first 4 characters of a string:

str = 'Interesting'
substring = str[0:4]
print(substring) # Inte

Syntax2: string[start:end:step]

Step is how many characters you move forward each time you read. If your step is 1, you read one character at a time. If your step is 2, you skip one character and then read the next one.

Let's say our string is 'abcde':

s = 'abcde'
print(s[0:4:2]) # Output: ac

Reverse Slicing:

s='abcde'
print(s[4:0:-1]) # Output: edcb
print(s[::-1]) # Output : edcba
